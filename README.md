Reflection Questions:

1.Flexible functions with parameters: I designed functions to accept inputs (like firstName, lastName, price, etc.) and used default values for optional parameters (like discount) to handle different use cases without changing the function.

2.Challenges with conditional logic: The main challenge was ensuring all possible scenarios were covered (e.g., missing names, age/employment combinations, invalid inputs) without creating conflicting or redundant conditions.

3.Refactoring benefits: Refactoring, such as adding an optional discount, makes the code cleaner, reusable, and easier to maintain, reducing duplication and improving readability.
